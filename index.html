In the Nineties, I found out that I could not have children. I started to volunteer in pediatric hospitals. It was at that time I heard about Patch Adams, the physician who dressed a clown to bring humor to children in hospitals. That is how I started to tell children stories that were funny and adventurous (but also full of good values) of a shy, tender and clumsy mouse: Geronimo Stilton!</p>
